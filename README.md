# ðŸ‘‹ Greetings!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a professional [AI representative](https://connor-haines.com).<br>
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for a job building products powered by AI.<br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about careers in climate tech through the ClimateBase Fellowship, and while I wouldn't say Climate Tech is the only industry I'm interested in, I would say that contributing to the ethical use of AI is a core value of mine.<br>
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how my academic philosophy training impacts prompt engineering.<br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I'm training for a 40-mile backcountry ski race!
