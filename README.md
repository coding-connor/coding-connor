# ðŸ‘‹ Greetings!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a professional [AI representative](https://connor-haines.com).

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for a job building products powered by AI.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about careers in climate tech through the ClimateBase Fellowship. I would love to work in climate tech, or another industry focused on creating ethically responsible software. 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how my academic philosophy training impacts prompt engineering.

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm training for a 40-mile backcountry ski race!
