# ðŸ‘‹ Greetings!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a professional [AI representative](https://connor-haines.com).

ðŸŒ± I'm most passionate about Decentralization technologies and Climate Tech, but I'm open to working in any exciting tech space. 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how my academic philosophy training impacts my approach to prompt engineering.

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm training for a 40-mile backcountry ski race! (Update: It's in coming up this weekend!!)
